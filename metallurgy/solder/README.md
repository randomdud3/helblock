Analysis:

- This one has lots of small details
- At t2 of both lead and tin, the primitive recipe (from both resin and alginic) uses a 25% less sludge, but it may have some drawbacks:
  - It requires more steps (smelting to the solder plate + more assemblers)
  - It requires 2.36 resin/s, which may be complex to make early on, since that require silver, aluminum, urea (iron/copper ore), or 2.25 alginic acid/s which is a stupid amount of farms (11.25 mk1, 8.5 mk2) and assemblers for those farms (15 mk2)
  - It requires more lead than tin (64% vs 36%) while the coil version require the same of both. This is affected by the fact that lead t3 requires Hexafluorosilic Acid, which requires silicon, aluminum and silver, while t3 tin is just carbon
