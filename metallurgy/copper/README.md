# COPPER PLATES/WIRES

## Options

- Coolant: Yes/No
- Casting: Strands/Normal - For wires it also explores the option of going with plates -> wires, marked as primitive wires
- Blasting: Basic Ore/Processed Ore/Pellets & Anodes

Analysis:

- Copper t3 requires 20 sulfuric acid for each ore processor mk2 to run. That would be 0.5sulfur/s, similar to the amount of excess sulfur produced by a bit over 4 sets of 5 washers mk1 doing geodes (4.16) (every setup does 11.1 excess sulfuric waste water or 0.12 sulfur). It could also be 7 washers mk1 doing mud water and using the Hydrogen Sulfide
- Technically, it's better to make wires out of plates once assemblers mk3/mk4 and prod 0 modules start being available for about a 18% savings in sludge (TODO: Add the prodded helmod). Bear in mind this increases the amount of required assemblers (and their modules) by about x5
